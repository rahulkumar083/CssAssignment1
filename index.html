    <h2 class="Main2">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="Main3">CSS is not necessary</span>
            <span class="Main4">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at
            once

        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="Main5">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="Main6">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="Main7">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span
                style="background-color: yellow;"> in this
                tutitorial we
                will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to
            try it
            yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="Main8">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
        elements.ID, on the
        other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</h3>
    <p class="Main9">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an
        element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.
    </p>
    <p class="Main10">
        There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied
